# Turning Data Into Information: Evaluating Reimbursements #

## Day 1 ##

**Our Dataset**

- Our team will use data representing McKesson's Q4 2020 write off vs. collected reimbursement amounts
- The data has been updated to mask the true names of the manufacturers and customers involved
- The dataset has over 56k records which will lend itself well to machine learning, and is pre-labeled with the binary "write off" or "resubmit" results

**The Questions We Will Ask**

- Can we transform this raw data set into more user-friendly visuals? 
- Are there any patterns shown in the data set?
- Can SK Learn help us predict which customers, suppliers, contracts, or drugs have a higher write off rate? 


**The Python Packages We Will Use**

- Pandas
- Panel
- Pathlib
- Plotly Express
- SKLearn
- Pydotplus
- HVPlot
- Mapbox API
- Dot ENV

## Day 2 ##

- Classifier model tuned to use fewer features, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy
- Good start on visuals
- PowerPoint shell started

# Day 3 ##
- PowerPoint nearly complete
- Classifier model finalized
- Continued work on visuals
